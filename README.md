This repository demonstrates a subtle but important behavior in Swift concerning the `reversed()` method.  The `reversed()` method on arrays returns a lazy sequence, not a copy of the array in reversed order. Consequently, any changes made to the reversed sequence directly affect the original array. This can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs if not properly understood. The example illustrates this behavior and proposes a solution using the `Array()` initializer to create a mutable copy of the reversed array.
